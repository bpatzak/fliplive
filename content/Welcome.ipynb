    "FLIP is Python Module for Parametric Structural Beam & Frame Analysis. This site hosts live JupiterLite notebook with FLIP.   ([FLIP homepage](https://github.com/bpatzak/flip)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## About FLIP\n",
    "\n",
    "FLIP is a lightweight, transparent, script‑driven environment for structural analysis. Built for students & engineers who want full control, reproducibility, and the freedom to automate everything — without the constraints of GUI‑based FEM tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on FLIP, visit [FLIP homepage](https://github.com/bpatzak/flip).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Why This Instead of a GUI?\n",
    "Traditional FEM software is powerful, but it locks you into fixed workflows, hidden assumptions, and manual clicking.\n",
    "This project takes the opposite approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Full transparency — every node, element, load, and solver step is visible in code\n",
    "* Parametric by design — geometry, loads, and materials are just variables\n",
    "* Automation & optimization — loops, sweeps, and design exploration become trivial\n",
    "* Reproducible & version‑controlled — models are plain text, perfect for Git\n",
    "* Custom visualization — filled N/V/M diagrams, diagrams on structure, hinge markers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Teaching friendly interface allows to focus on key FEM aspects while reducing tedious work \n",
    "* Fully extensible — add new loads, materials, solvers, or post‑processing routines\n",
    "\n",
    "This is structural analysis for students & engineers who want to think, not click.\n",
    "\n",
